<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is an application software for reading the introduction of a book.</p>
<p>This software was developed to improve the rate of customers purchasing a book from a book store or the users selecting a book from the library. This idea could be also used in robotics to create a robot for the bookstore or library.</p>
<p>In this project the name of the book and introduction of the book is stored into the database by the system administrator.</p>
<p>The user can search the book by using three different options:<p>
<ul>
  <li>By manually typing the name of the book</li>
  <li>By uploading the coverpage of the book (automatically reads the title)</li>
  <li>By taking snapshot of the coverpage (automatically reads the title)</li>
</ul>
